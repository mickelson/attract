<a name="overview" />
Overview
--------

The Attract-mode layout sets out what gets displayed to the user. Layouts
consist of a `layout.nut` script file and a collection of related resources
(images, other scripts, etc.) used by the script.

Layouts are stored under the "layouts" subdirectory of the Attract-Mode
config directory.  Each layout is stored in its own separate subdirectory or
archive file (Attract-Mode can read layouts and plugins directly from .zip,
.7z, .rar, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2 and .tar files).

Each layout can have one or more `layout*.nut` script files.  The "Toggle
Layout" command in Attract-Mode allows users to cycle between each of the
`layout*.nut` script files located in the layout's directory.  Attract-Mode
remembers the last layout file toggled to for each layout and will go back
to that same file the next time the layout is loaded.  This allows for
variations of a particular layout to be implemented and easily selected by
the user (for example, a layout could provide a `layout.nut` for horizontal
monitor orientations and a `layout-vert.nut` for vertical).

The Attract-Mode screen saver and intro modes are really just special case
layouts.  The screensaver gets loaded after a user-configured period of
inactivity, while the intro mode gets run when the frontend first starts and
exits as soon as any action is triggered (for example if the user hits the
select button).  The screen saver script is located in the `screensaver.nut`
file stored in the "screensaver" subdirectory.  The intro script is located
in the `intro.nut` file stored in the "intro" subdirectory.

Plug-ins are similar to layouts in that they consist of at least one squirrel
script file and a collection of related resources.  Plug-ins are stored in the
"plugins" subdirectory of the Attract-Mode config directory.  Plug-ins can be a
single ".nut" file stored in this subdirectory.  They can also have their own
separate subdirectory or archive file (in which case the script itself needs to
be in a file called `plugin.nut`).


<a name="squirrel" />
Squirrel Language
-----------------

Attract-Mode's layouts are scripts written in the Squirrel programming
language.  Squirrel's standard "Blob", "IO", "Math", "String" and "System"
library functions are available for use in a script. For more information on
programming in Squirrel and using its standard libraries, consult the Squirrel
manuals:

   * [Squirrel 3.0 Reference Manual][SQREFMAN]
   * [Squirrel 3.0 Standard Library Manual][SQLIBMAN]

[SQREFMAN]: http://www.squirrel-lang.org/doc/squirrel3.html
[SQLIBMAN]: http://www.squirrel-lang.org/doc/sqstdlib3.html

https://github.com/mickelson/attract/wiki/Introduction-to-Squirrel-Programming


<a name="squirrel_ext" />
Language Extensions
-------------------

Attract-Mode includes the following home-brewed extensions to the squirrel
language and standard libraries:

   * A `zip_extract_archive( zipfile, filename )` function that will open a
     specified `zipfile` archive file and extract `filename` from it, returning
     the contents as a squirrel blob.
   * A `zip_get_dir( zipfile )` function that will return an array of the
     filenames contained in the `zipfile` archive file.

Supported archive formats are: .zip, .7z, .rar, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2 and .tar

<a name="binding" />
Frontend Binding
----------------

All of the functions, objects and classes that Attract-Mode exposes to
Squirrel are arranged under the `fe` table, which is bound to Squirrel's
root table.

Example:

		fe.layout.base_rotation = RotateScreen.Right;
		fe.add_image( "bg.png", 0, 0 );
		local marquee = fe.add_artwork( "marquee", 256, 20, 512, 256 );
		marquee.set_rgb( 100, 100, 100 );

The remainder of this document describes the functions, objects, classes
and constants that are exposed to layout and plug-in scripts.

<a name="magic" />
Magic Tokens
----------------

Image names, as well as the messages displayed by Text and Listbox objects, can
all contain one or more "Magic Tokens".  Magic tokens are enclosed in square
brackets, and the frontend automatically updates them accordingly as the user
navigates the frontend.  So for example, a Text message set to
"[Manufacturer]" will be automatically updated with the appropriate
Manufacturer's name.  There are more examples below.

   * The following magic tokens are currently supported:
      - `[DisplayName]` - the name of the current display
      - `[ListSize]` - the number of items in the game list
      - `[ListEntry]` - the number of the current selection in the game list
      - `[FilterName]` - the name of the filter
      - `[Search]` - the search rule currently applied to the game list
      - `[SortName]` - the attribute that the list was sorted by
      - `[Name]` - the short name of the selected game
      - `[Title]` - the full name of the selected game
      - `[Emulator]` - the emulator to use for the selected game
      - `[CloneOf]` - the short name of the game that the selection is a
        clone of
      - `[Year]` - the year for the selected game
      - `[Manufacturer]` - the manufacturer for the selected game
      - `[Category]` - the category for the selected game
      - `[Players]` - the number of players for the selected game
      - `[Rotation]` - the rotation for the selected game
      - `[Control]` - the primary control for the selected game
      - `[Status]` - the emulation status for the selected game
      - `[DisplayCount]` - the number of displays for the selected game
      - `[DisplayType]` - the display type for the selected game
      - `[AltRomname]` - the alternative Romname for the selected game
      - `[AltTitle]` - the alternative title for the selected game
      - `[PlayedTime]` - the amount of time the selected game has been
        played
      - `[PlayedCount]` - the number of times the selected game has been
        played
      - `[SortValue]` - the value used to order the selected game in the
        list
      - `[System]` - the first "System" name configured for the selected
        game's emulator
      - `[SystemN]` - the last "System" name configured for the selected
        game's emulator
      - `[Overview]` - the overview description for the selected game
   * Magic tokens can also be used to run a function defined in your layout
     or plugin's squirrel script to obtain the desired text.  These tokens are
     in the form `[!<function_name>]`.  When used, Attract-Mode will run the
     corresponding function (defined in the squirrel "root table").  This
     function should then return the string value that you wish to have
     replace the magic token.  The function defined in squirrel can optionally
     have up to two parameters passed to it.  If it is defined with a first
     parameter, Attract-Mode will supply the appropriate index_offset in that
     parameter  when it calls the function.  If a second parameter is present
     as well, the appropriate filter_offset is supplied.

Examples:

		// Add a text that displays the filter name and list location
		//
		fe.add_text( "[FilterName] [[ListEntry]/[ListSize]]",
				0, 0, 400, 20 );

		// Add an image that will match to the first word in the
		// Manufacturer name (i.e. "Atari.png", "Nintendo.jpg")
		//
		function strip_man( ioffset )
		{
			local m = fe.game_info(Info.Manufacturer,ioffset);
			return split( m, " " )[0];
		}
		fe.add_image( "[!strip_man]", 0, 0 );

		// Add a text that will display a copyright message if both
		// the manufacturer name and a year are present.  Otherwise,
		// just show the Manufactuer name.
		//
		function well_formatted()
		{
			local m = fe.game_info( Info.Manufacturer );
			local y = fe.game_info( Info.Year );

			if (( m.len() > 0 ) && ( y.len() > 0 ))
				return "Copyright " + y + ", " + m;

			return m;
		}
		fe.add_text( "[!well_formatted]", 0, 0 );


<a name="functions" />
Functions
---------

<a name="add_image" />
#### `fe.add_image()` ####

    fe.add_image( name )
    fe.add_image( name, x, y )
    fe.add_image( name, x, y, w, h )

Adds an image or video to the end of Attract-Mode's draw list.

[Magic Tokens](#magic) can be used in the supplied "name", in which case
Attract-Mode will dynamically update the image in response to navigation.

Parameters:

   * name - the name of an image/video file to show.  If a relative path is
     provided (i.e. "bg.png") it is assumed to be relative to the current
     layout directory (or the plugin directory, if called from  a plugin
     script).  If a relative path is provided and the layout/plugin is
     contained in an archive, Attract-Mode will open the corresponding file
     stored inside of the archive.  Supported image formats are: PNG, JPEG,
     GIF, BMP and TGA.  Videos can be in any format supported by FFmpeg.  One
     or more "Magic Tokens" can be used in the name, in which case Attract-Mode
     will automatically update the image/video file appropriately in response
     to user navigation.  For example "man/[Manufacturer]" will load
     the file corresponding to the manufacturer's name from the man
     subdirectory of the layout/plugin (example: "man/Konami.png"). When
     Magic Tokens are used, the file extension specified in `name` is ignored
     (if present) and Attract-Mode will load any supported media file that
     matches the Magic Token.  See [Magic Tokens](#magic) for more info.
   * x - the x coordinate of the top left corner of the image (in layout
     coordinates).
   * y - the y coordinate of the top left corner of the image (in layout
     coordinates).
   * w - the width of the image (in layout coordinates).  Image will be
     scaled accordingly.  If set to 0 image is left unscaled.  Default value
     is 0.
   * h - the height of the image (in layout coordinates).  Image will be
     scaled accordingly.  If set to 0 image is left unscaled.  Default value
     is 0.

Return Value:

   * An instance of the class [`fe.Image`](#Image) which can be used to
     interact with the added image/video.


<a name="add_artwork" />
#### `fe.add_artwork()` ####

    fe.add_artwork( label )
    fe.add_artwork( label, x, y )
    fe.add_artwork( label, x, y, w, h )

Add an artwork to the end of Attract-Mode's draw list.  The image/video
displayed in an artwork is updated automatically whenever the user changes
the game selection.

Parameters:

   * label - the label of the artwork to display.  This should correspond
     to an artwork configured in Attract-Mode (artworks are configured per
     emulator in the config menu) or scraped using the scraper.  Attract-
     Mode's standard artwork labels are: "snap", "marquee", "flyer", "wheel",
     and "fanart".
   * x - the x coordinate of the top left corner of the artwork (in layout
     coordinates).
   * y - the y coordinate of the top left corner of the artwork (in layout
     coordinates).
   * w - the width of the artwork (in layout coordinates).  Artworks will be
     scaled accordingly.  If set to 0 artwork is left unscaled.  Default
     value is 0.
   * h - the height of the artwork (in layout coordinates).  Artworks will be
     scaled accordingly.  If set to 0 artwork is left unscaled.  Default
     value is 0.

Return Value:

   * An instance of the class [`fe.Image`](#Image) which can be used to
     interact with the added artwork.


<a name="add_surface" />
#### `fe.add_surface()` ####

    fe.add_surface( w, h )

Add a surface to the end of Attract-Mode's draw list.  A surface is an off-
screen texture upon which you can draw other image, artwork, text, listbox
and surface objects.  The resulting texture is treated as a static image by
Attract-Mode which can in turn have image effects applied to it (scale,
position, pinch, skew, shaders, etc) when it is drawn.

Parameters:

   * w - the width of the surface texture (in pixels).
   * h - the height of the surface texture (in pixels).

Return Value:

   * An instance of the class [`fe.Image`](#Image) which can be used to
     interact with the added surface.


<a name="add_clone" />
#### `fe.add_clone()` ####

    fe.add_clone( img )

Clone an image, artwork or surface object and add the clone to the back
of Attract-Mode's draw list.  The texture pixel data of the original and
clone is shared as a result.

Parameters:

   * img - the image, artwork or surface object to clone.  This needs to
     be an instance of the class `fe.Image`.

Return Value:

   * An instance of the class [`fe.Image`](#Image) which can be used to
     interact with the added clone.


<a name="add_text" />
#### `fe.add_text()` ####

    fe.add_text( msg, x, y, w, h )

Add a text label to the end of Attract-Mode's draw list.

[Magic Tokens](#magic) can be used in the supplied "msg", in which case
Attract-Mode will dynamically update the msg in response to navigation.

Parameters:

   * msg - the text to display.  Magic tokens can be used here, see
     [Magic Tokens](#magic) for more information.
   * x - the x coordinate of the top left corner of the text (in layout
     coordinates).
   * y - the y coordinate of the top left corner of the text (in layout
     coordinates).
   * w - the width of the text (in layout coordinates).
   * h - the height of the text (in layout coordinates).

Return Value:

   * An instance of the class [`fe.Text`](#Text) which can be used to
     interact with the added text.


<a name="add_listbox" />
#### `fe.add_listbox()` ####

    fe.add_listbox( x, y, w, h )

Add a listbox to the end of Attract-Mode's draw list.

Parameters:

   * x - the x coordinate of the top left corner of the listbox (in layout
     coordinates).
   * y - the y coordinate of the top left corner of the listbox (in layout
     coordinates).
   * w - the width of the listbox (in layout coordinates).
   * h - the height of the listbox (in layout coordinates).

Return Value:

   * An instance of the class [`fe.ListBox`](#ListBox) which can be used to
     interact with the added text.


<a name="add_shader" />
#### `fe.add_shader()` ####

    fe.add_shader( type, file1, file2 )
    fe.add_shader( type, file1 )
    fe.add_shader( type )

Add a GLSL shader (vertex and/or fragment) for use in the layout.

Parameters:

   * type - the type of shader to add.  Can be one of the following values:
      - `Shader.VertexAndFragment` - add a combined vertex and fragment shader
      - `Shader.Vertex` - add a vertex shader
      - `Shader.Fragment` - add a fragment shader
      - `Shader.Empty` - add an empty shader.  An object's shader property can
        be set to an empty shader to stop using a shader on that object where
        one was set previously.

   * file1 - the name of the shader file located in the layout/plugin directory.
     For the VertexAndFragment type, this should be the vertex shader.
   * file2 - This parameter is only used with the VertexAndFragment type, and
     should be the name of the fragment shader file located in the layout/
     plugin directory.

Return Value:

   * An instance of the class [`fe.Shader`](#Shader) which can be used to
     interact with the added shader.

#### Implementation note for GLSL shaders in Attract-Mode: ####

Shaders are implemented using the SFML API.  For more information please see:
http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/graphics-shader.php

The minimal vertex shader expected is as follows:

    void main()
    {
        // transform the vertex position
        gl_Position = gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix * gl_Vertex;

        // transform the texture coordinates
        gl_TexCoord[0] = gl_TextureMatrix[0] * gl_MultiTexCoord0;

        // forward the vertex color
        gl_FrontColor = gl_Color;
    }

The minimal fragment shader expected is as follows:

    uniform sampler2D texture;

    void main()
    {
        // lookup the pixel in the texture
        vec4 pixel = texture2D(texture, gl_TexCoord[0].xy);

        // multiply it by the color
        gl_FragColor = gl_Color * pixel;
    }


<a name="add_sound" />
#### `fe.add_sound()` ####

    fe.add_sound( name, reuse )
    fe.add_sound( name )

Add an audio file that can then be played by Attract-Mode.

Parameters:

   * name - the name of the audio file.  If a relative path is provided,
     it is treated as relative to the directory for the layout/plugin that
     called this function.
   * reuse - [bool] if set to true, reuse any previously added sound that
     has the same name.  Default value is true.

Return Value:

   * An instance of the class [`fe.Sound`](#Sound) which can be used to
     interact with the sound.


<a name="add_ticks_callback" />
#### `fe.add_ticks_callback()` ####

    fe.add_ticks_callback( environment, function_name )
    fe.add_ticks_callback( function_name )

Register a function in your script to get "tick" callbacks.  Tick callbacks
occur continuously during the running of the frontend.  The function that is
registered should be in the following form:

    function tick( tick_time )
    {
       // do stuff...
    }

The single parameter passed to the tick function is the amount of time (in
milliseconds) since the layout began.

Parameters:

   * environment - the squirrel object that the function is associated with
     (default value: the root table of the squirrel vm)
   * function_name - a string naming the function to be called.

Return Value:

   * None.


<a name="add_transition_callback" />
#### `fe.add_transition_callback()` ####

    fe.add_transition_callback( environment, function_name )
    fe.add_transition_callback( function_name )

Register a function in your script to get transition callbacks.  Transition
callbacks are triggered by certain events in the frontend.  The function
that is registered should be in the following form:

    function transition( ttype, var, transition_time )
    {
       local redraw_needed = false;

       // do stuff...

       if ( redraw_needed )
          return true;

       return false;
    }

The `ttype` parameter passed to the transition function indicates what is
happening.  It will have one of the following values:

   * `Transition.StartLayout`
   * `Transition.EndLayout`
   * `Transition.ToNewSelection`
   * `Transition.FromOldSelection`
   * `Transition.ToGame`
   * `Transition.FromGame`
   * `Transition.ToNewList`
   * `Transition.EndNavigation`
   * `Transition.ShowOverlay`
   * `Transition.HideOverlay`
   * `Transition.NewSelOverlay`
   * `Transition.ChangedTag`

The value of the `var` parameter passed to the transition function depends
upon the value of `ttype`:

   * When `ttype` is `Transition.ToNewSelection`, `var` indicates the index
     offset of the selection being transitioned to (i.e. -1 when moving back
     one position in the list, 1 when moving forward one position, 2 when
     moving forward two positions, etc.)

   * When `ttype` is `Transition.FromOldSelection`, `var` indicates the index
     offset of the selection being transitioned from (i.e. 1 after moving back
     one position in the list, -1 after moving forward one position, -2 after
     moving forward two positions, etc.)

   * When `ttype` is `Transition.StartLayout`, `var` will be one of the
     following:
      - `FromTo.Frontend` if the frontend is just starting,
      - `FromTo.ScreenSaver` if the layout is starting (or the list is being
        loaded) because the built-in screen saver has stopped, or
      - `FromTo.NoValue` otherwise.

   * When `ttype` is `Transition.EndLayout`, `var` will be:
      - `FromTo.Frontend` if the frontend is shutting down,
      - `FromTo.ScreenSaver` if the layout is stopping because the built-in
        screen saver is starting, or
      - `FromTo.NoValue` otherwise.

   * When `ttype` is `Transition.ToNewList`, `var` indicates the filter index
     offset of the filter being transitioned to (i.e. -1 when moving back one
     filter, 1 when moving forward) if known, otherwise `var` is 0.

   * When `ttype` is `Transition.ShowOverlay`, var will be:
      - `Overlay.Custom` if a script generated overlay is being shown
      - `Overlay.Exit` if the exit menu is being shown
      - `Overlay.Favourite` if the add/remove favourite menu is being shown
      - `Overlay.Displays` if the displays menu is being shown
      - `Overlay.Filters` if the filters menu is being shown
      - `Overlay.Tags` if the tags menu is being shown

   * When `ttype` is `Transition.NewSelOverlay`, var will be the index of the
     new selection in the Overlay menu.

   * When `ttype` is `Transition.ChangedTag`, var will be `Info.Favourite` if
     the favourite status of the current game was changed, and `Info.Tags` if
     a tag for the current game was changed.

   * When `ttype` is `Transition.ToGame`, `Transition.FromGame`,
     `Transition.EndNavigation`, or `Transition.HideOverlay`, `var` will be
     `FromTo.NoValue`.

The `transition_time` parameter passed to the transition function is the
amount of time (in milliseconds) since the transition began.

The transition function must return a boolean value.  It should return
`true` if a redraw is required, in which case Attract-Mode will redraw the
screen and immediately call the transition function again with an updated
`transition_time`.

**The transition function must eventually return `false` to notify
Attract-Mode that the transition effect is done, allowing the normal
operation of the frontend to proceed.**

Parameters:

   * environment - the squirrel object that the function is associated with
     (default value: the root table of the squirrel vm)
   * function_name - a string naming the function to be called.

Return Value:

   * None.


<a name="game_info" />
#### `fe.game_info()` ####

    fe.game_info( id )
    fe.game_info( id, index_offset )
    fe.game_info( id, index_offset, filter_offset )

Get information about the selected game.

Parameters:

   * id - id of the information attribute to get.  Can be one of the
     following values:
      - `Info.Name`
      - `Info.Title`
      - `Info.Emulator`
      - `Info.CloneOf`
      - `Info.Year`
      - `Info.Manufacturer`
      - `Info.Category`
      - `Info.Players`
      - `Info.Rotation`
      - `Info.Control`
      - `Info.Status`

index of the fe.displays array that contains the intended display.

NOTE that changing the display causes all layout and plugin scripts to reload.

Parameters:

   * index - The index of the display to change to.  This should correspond to
   the index in the fe.displays array of the intended new display.  The index for
   the current display is stored in `fe.list.display_index`.

<a name="add_signal_handler" />
#### `fe.add_signal_handler()` ####


    fe.add_signal_handler( environment, function_name )
    fe.add_signal_handler( function_name )

Register a function in your script to handle signals.  Signals are sent
whenever a mapped control is used by the user or whenever a layout or
plugin script uses the [`fe.signal()`](#signal) function.  The function
that is registered should be in the following form:

    function handler( signal_str )
    {
       local no_more_processing = false;

       // do stuff...

       if ( no_more_processing )
          return true;

       return false;
    }

The `signal_str` parameter passed to the handler function is a string
that identifies the signal that has been given.  This string will
correspond to the `signal_str` parameter values of [`fe.signal()`](#signal)

The signal handler function should return a boolean value.  It should
return `true` if no more processing should be done on this signal.
It should return `false` if signal processing is to continue, in which
case this signal will be dealt with in the default manner by the
frontend.

Parameters:

   * environment - the squirrel object that the function is associated with
     (default value: the root table of the squirrel vm)
   * function_name - a string naming the signal handler function to
     be added.

Return Value:

   * None.

<a name="ImageNotes" />
Notes:

   * Note that Attract-Mode defers the loading of artwork and dynamic images
     (images with Magic Tokens) until after all layout and plug-in scripts have
     completed running.  This means that the `texture_width`, `texture_height`
     and `file_name` attributes are not available when a layout or plug-in
     script first adds the artwork/dynamic image resource.  These attributes
     are available during transition callbacks, and in particular during the
     `Transition.FromOldSelection` and `Transition.ToNewList` transitions.
     Example:

```` squirrel
   local my_art = fe.add_artwork( "snap", 0, 0, 100, 100 );

   fe.add_transition_callback("artwork_transition");
   function artwork_transition( ttype, var, ttime )
   {
      if (( ttype == Transition.FromOldSelection )
         || ( ttype == Transition.ToNewList ))
      {
         //
         // do stuff with my_art's texture_width or texture_height here...
         //
         // for example, flip the image vertically:
         my_art.subimg_height = -1 * texture_height;
         my_art.subimg_y = texture_height;
      }

      return false;
   }

````

   * To flip an image vertically, set the `subimg_height` property to
     `-1 * texture_height` and `subimg_y` to `texture_height`.
   * To flip an image horizontally, set the `subimg_width` property to
     `-1 * texture_width` and `subimg_x` to `texture_width`.

```` squirrel

   // flip "img" vertically
   function flip_y( img )
   {
      img.subimg_height = -1 * img.texture_height;
      img.subimg_y = img.texture_height;
   }
````
   * To rotate an image around its centre, set the origin_x and origin_y
     values to one half of the image's width and height (respectively)
     and then set the 'rotation' value accordingly

```` squirrel

   local img = fe.add_image( "img.png", 100, 100, 200, 200 );
   img.origin_x = 100;
   img.origin_y = 100;
   img.rotation = 90; // rotate img around its centre
