Compiling Attract-Mode
----------------------

Build instructions are set out by operating system below:

Linux, FreeBSD, Ubuntu:
----------------------

These instructions assume that you have the GNU C/C++ compilers and basic
build utilities (make, pkg-config, ar) on your system.  This means the
"build-essential" and "pkg-config" packages on Debian or Ubuntu-based
distributions.  Other distributions should have similar packages available.

1. Install the following *development* libraries on your system [use sudo apt-get install xxx, where xxx should be replaced by the library name between brackets, eg. sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev]:
   * Required:
      - SFML SDK version 2.x (<http://sfml-dev.org>) [libsfml-dev]
      - OpenAL [libopenal-dev]
      - Zlib [zlib1g-dev]
      - FreeType 2 [libfreetype6-dev]
      - The following FFmpeg libraries (required for videos): 
          * avformat [libavformat-dev],
          * avcodec [libavcodec-dev], 
          * swscale [libswscale-dev], 
          * avutil [libavutil-dev],
          * swresample [libswresample-dev] or avresample [libavresample-dev].
      - OpenGL and GLU (or OpenGLES for GLES version) [freeglut3-dev]
      - JPEG library [libjpeg-dev]
      - Make [make] and Package Config [pkg-config]
   * Optional:
      - Fontconfig (to assist with finding fonts).
      - Xinerama (for multiple monitor support).
      - libarchive (for .7z, .rar, .tar.gz and .tar.bz2 archive support). [libarchive-dev]
      
For Ubuntu, run :

           apt install build-essential pkg-config libsfml-dev libopenal-dev zlib1g-dev libfreetype6-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libswscale-dev libavutil-dev libswresample-dev freeglut3-dev libjpeg-dev libarchive-dev

2. Extract the Attract-Mode source to your system.

3. From the directory you extracted the source into, run:

           make

   or, if you are building on a Raspberry Pi, O-Droid or another embedded
   system, you can build the OpenGL ES version with the following:

           make USE_GLES=1

   This step will create the "attract" executable file.

4. The final step is to actually copy the Attract-Mode executable and data
   to a location where they can be used.  To install on a system-wide basis
   you should run:

           sudo make install

   This will copy the "attract" executable to `/usr/local/bin/` and default
   data to `/usr/local/share/attract/`.  Note: if you are building the OpenGL
   ES version you need to include the `USE_GLES=1` parameter here as well.

   For a single user install on Linux or FreeBSD, you can complete this step
   by copying the contents of the "config" directory from the Attract-Mode
   source directory to the location that you will use as your Attract-Mode
   config directory.  By default, this config directory is located in
   `$HOME/.attract` on Linux/FreeBSD systems.

   NOTE: The Attract-Mode makefile tries to follow the GNU standards for
   specifying installation directories: <https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html>.
   If you want to change the location where Attract-Mode looks for its default
   data from `/usr/local/share/attract` you should change these values
   appropriately before running the `make` and `make install` commands.

OS X:
-----

These instructions assume that you have X Code installed.

1. Install Homebrew (<http://brew.sh>).  This can be done by running the
   following command at a terminal command prompt:

           ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

2.  Install the "pkg-config", "ffmpeg", "sfml" and "libarchive" homebrew
    recipes:

           brew update
           brew install pkg-config ffmpeg sfml libarchive

3. Extract the Attract-Mode source to your system.

4. From the directory you extracted the Attract-Mode source into, run:

           make

   This step will create the "attract" executable file.

5. The final step is to actually copy the Attract-Mode executable and data to
   the location where they will be used.  You can run:

           sudo make install

   to install on a system-wide basis.  This will copy the 'attract' executable
   to `/usr/local/bin/` and data to `/usr/local/share/attract/`

   If you prefer to do a single user install, you can complete this step by
   copying the contents of the "config" directory from the Attract-Mode
   source directory to the location that you will use as your Attract-Mode
   config directory.  By default, this config directory is `$HOME/.attract` on
   OS X.

Windows (cross-compile):
------------------------

The recommended way to build Windows binaries for Attract-Mode is to cross
compile on an OS that supports MXE (<http://mxe.cc>) such as Linux, FreeBSD or
OS X.

1. Follow the steps in the mxe tutorial to set up mxe on your system:
   <http://mxe.cc/#tutorial>

2. Make mxe's sfml, ffmpeg and libarchive packages:

           make ffmpeg sfml libarchive

   the above command will make 32-bit versions of ffmpeg and sfml (and anything
   else that they depend on). To make the 64-bit version use the following:

           make MXE_TARGETS='x86_64-w64-mingw32.static' ffmpeg sfml libarchive

3. Extract the Attract-Mode source to your system.

4. From the directory you extracted the source into, run the following:

           make CROSS=1 TOOLCHAIN=i686-w64-mingw32.static WINDOWS_STATIC=1

   to build the 32-bit version of Attract-Mode. To build 64-bit, run:

           make CROSS=1 TOOLCHAIN=x86_64-w64-mingw32.static WINDOWS_STATIC=1

   This step will create the "attract.exe" executable file.

5. Copy the contents of the config directory from the Attract-Mode source
   directory and the executable you just built into the same directory on your
   Windows-based system, and you should be ready to go!

Windows (native compile):
-------------------------

1. Install MSYS2
   <https://msys2.github.io/>

2. Launch the MSYS2 shell and update the system:

           pacman --needed -Sy bash pacman pacman-mirrors msys2-runtime

3. Close MSYS2 Shell,  run it again and run the following command:

           pacman -Syu

4. Install required packaged. (optionally use the mingw-w64-i686-toolchain
   instead for 32-bit windows architectures), install "all" (by default) :

           pacman -S git mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain msys/make mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-sfml mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-ffmpeg mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-libarchive

5. Clone and make Attract-Mode

           git clone https://github.com/mickelson/attract attract
           cd attract
           make

This builds a version of Attract-Mode with various .dll dependencies.  To
run the program, you will need to add `c:\msys64\mingw64\bin` to your path
(for 64-bit systems) or copy the dependent .dlls from that directory into
the same directory you will run Attract-Mode from.
